    <h1>Weirdest houses </h1>
    <h3>
<b> 1. A contemporary residence built between 1970 and 1972 with a whimsically odd appearance that resembles mushrooms. The interior rooms in this pod home are decorated in mosaic tiling and the structure’s design patterned after a stem of Queen Anne’s lace.</b><br><br>
<i>2. Thierry Atta was an apprentice of the artist Moussa Kalo, who designed and built the house. The house looks like a massive smiling crocodile, hollowed out to create the room inside the body of the reptile. It has windows and the bed and is completely livable.</i><br><br>
<s>3. This sculpture, made of cedar wood, depicts a tall house bent on its side. The roof of the house digs into the forest floor and five square, glass windows travel upwards on the house and a distorted door juts to the right, open for viewers to interact with.</s><br></br>
